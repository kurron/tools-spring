 * the process into the process. This form of inbound gateway specializes in processing
 * REST requests.
 *
 * <p>This annotation serves as a specialization of {@link org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController @RestController},
 * allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning. This annotation also
 * qualifies the gateway with the label of  <em>production</em>.  This allows you to select the production
 * gateways for your contract tests.</p>
